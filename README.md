# Curl-Extension

Curl-Extension is a library built on top of libcurl, providing easy-to-use client implementations for various protocols. Our goal is to simplify API usage and reduce development time.

## FTP Client

We have currently implemented an FTP client. The FTP client supports functionalities such as downloading files, uploading files, downloading entire directories, uploading entire directories, concurrent operations support for directory transfers, automatic creation of directories on the server and local machine, and an option to delete files on the server after successful download.

You can find detailed usage instructions for the FTP client in the [README.md](https://github.com/Mr-song9/curl-extension/blob/main/ftp-client/README.md) file.

## Contributing

We welcome contributions to extend the library and add more protocol implementations. If you'd like to contribute, please submit a pull request or open an issue.
